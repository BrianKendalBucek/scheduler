# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a Single Page Application where you can add, edit, or delete interview appointments. It is a ReactJS app that relies on an API server using a PostgreSql database. This project was developed using the Test Driven Development method. Individual components are tested seperately, and End-to-End testing has also been completed.

## Features

- User can switch between days
- Detailed information is displayed on each appointment
- User can book interviews by typing in their or another students name, as well as select their desired interviewer from a list
- An existing interview appointment can be canceled, with a confirmation message for extra security
- User can clearly see which days are available or taken
